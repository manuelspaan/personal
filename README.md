My personal website

I've always been interested in coding a personal website, and after buying a domain I started designing my site right away.

After finalizing the design I programmed the design in HTML & CSS without too much effort. After that I added hover animations and a responsive layout. Who would've guessed that only required one line of code.

I'll be working on this website when I have the time and ideas for new features. Any tips for my code? I' all ears
